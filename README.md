- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @carlosjnaranjo (Carlos J Naranjo).
- ðŸ‘€ I have been primarily a Linux/Unix systems administrator, with some programming experience (Perl, Shell Scripting, etc), ITIL foundations, plenty of infrastructure and operations.
- Well versed on VMWare (vSAN, vCenter), SAN storage (XtremIO, Unity), Backups (Avamar, Cohesity) and F5 Load Balancers (BigIP LTM) as well as some automation either via scripting or via Ansible.
- I am currently starting to broaden my Python experience.

Why I don't use my repo that often? just because I have my employer's internal repos.

Some achievements/certifications:
- [Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator](https://www.credly.com/badges/90970ff9-d2b3-418a-b5f7-f8494da44b06/public_url).
- [GitHub Administration](https://www.credly.com/badges/74ab5e83-a19e-489e-b9c5-97d667499122/public_url).
